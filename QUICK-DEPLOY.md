2. Sign up with email or GitHub (free)
3. **Drag & drop** the `lucklab-frontend` folder

### Step 2: Add Your Custom Domain (1 minute)
1. In Netlify dashboard, click **"Domain settings"**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `yourdomain.com`
4. Netlify will show you DNS records to add

### Step 3: Update DNS (2 minutes)
Go to your domain registrar (where you bought your domain):

**Add these records:**

**Record 1 (for yourdomain.com):**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: Automatic
```

**Record 2 (for www.yourdomain.com):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [your-site-name].netlify.app
TTL: Automatic
```

### Step 4: Wait & Test

## ðŸ”¥ Pro Tips

**Tip 1**: Use both `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com`
- Add both in Netlify â†’ "Domain settings"
- Netlify will auto-redirect `www` to non-www (or vice versa)

**Tip 2**: Enable HTTPS (Free SSL)
- Netlify does this automatically after DNS is configured
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Your site will be `https://yourdomain.com`

**Tip 3**: Connect GitHub for Auto-Deploys
- Push `lucklab-frontend` to GitHub
- Connect GitHub to Netlify
- Every update auto-deploys!

**Tip 4**: Test DNS Propagation
- Go to [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
- Enter your domain
- See if DNS has propagated worldwide

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Domain not found" error?
- Wait longer (DNS can take up to 48 hours)
- Check DNS records are correct
- Clear browser cache

### Site loads but no backend data?
- Start your backend: `START-EVERYTHING.bat`
- Check IP address in `js/insightai.js` is correct (192.168.1.102)
- Make sure PC is on and connected to internet

### SSL certificate not working?
- Wait 10 minutes after DNS is configured
- Netlify auto-provisions SSL
- Try force HTTPS in Netlify settings

### Backend can't connect?
- Your PC's IP may have changed
- Run `FIND-MY-IP.bat` to check
- Update IP in `js/insightai.js` if needed
- Redeploy to Netlify
